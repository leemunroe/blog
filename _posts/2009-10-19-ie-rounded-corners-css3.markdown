  content: "I agree. Rounded corners are usually just there to add a little flair
    to a design. \r\n\r\nAs long as the site looks ok and is usable in IE then there's
    no problem. I just wish that the W3C CSS validator would throw up warnings instead
    of errors when it encounters CSS3."

    fields. I really with that IE would start supporting CSS3 the way Firefox and
    Safari do.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether the typical IE user cares about these subtle
    interface refinements... but maybe I'm wrong?! It bugs me though when IE users
    can't see things exactly the way I'd like them to."

    Found a number of things that Mr Clarke talked about at FOWD Belfast very interesting…
    Although controversial, the benefits of designing within the browser are there
    to be seen. I'm adopting a similar approach to a few things I'm working on at
    the moment.\r\n\r\nSo long as a design degrades gracefully in regressive browsers,
    no kittens will die."

    Explorer, if that's what you choose to use, then it's fine. It makes you think
    about people who have no clue about the browser wars or computers in general and
    just use IE6 because that's what their old pc came with many years ago.  How is
    their view of the web?  Everything must be all over the place, overlapping here
    and cut off there. I'd say surfing the web is not a great experience at all for
    them.\r\n\r\nAlthough, this is valid if you're using Internet Explorer by choice.
    What about design savvy people who have to use IE on their work computers? Those
    poor poor people. :("

    IE6 must just hate surfing the web as it's always a crazy experience.  It would
    be interesting to experience a day in IE6 for once, but I couldn't bring myself
    to do it. :)"

  content: I agree with the "if it works in IE that's enough" comments. It always
    pains me to have a site that functions well in all browsers and then I launch
    IE and it's all over the place for some stupid reason. IE is now a "functionality"
    afterthought, regardless of what percentage of visitors I have who use it, if
    they are forcing me, especially to cater for IE6 they don't deserve the bells
    and whistles. Besides, most of them think yahoo or the google searchbar is their
    browser and haven't actually got a clue what browser they're using.

  content: Very much agree. I think it's all too easy for designers to try too hard
    catering to the lowest common denominator in their designs. If you can develop
    a design that degrades gracefully then it's a much better option, because you're
    providing clients with the best possible use of the more advanced browsers while
    also ensuring that users with older software aren't locked out.

  content: "I kinda agree and I kinda don't Lee. The rounded corner thing was the
    first thing I tried in CSS3, and I used it on a couple of nav items on my personal
    portfolio site.\r\n\r\nI fully understand the reasoning behind sticking the CSS3
    value in, it's easier and to a certain extent it degrades OK. But for example
    on my last site design, I gave the whole site and buttons a rounded corner look.
    This was part of the design decision as I wanted to give the company a friendly
    look. In this case I used images for my buttons and the overall site, which was
    more difficult than just rounding the corners, but i believe it was the right
    decision.\r\n\r\nI believe you should have a reason for using rounded corners.
    This shouldn't exclude IE users if the only reason is that it is simpler to do
    without the hassle."

  content: "One of the worst things about all the additional improvements that come
    with new technologies, advances in HTML, CSS etc. is that when you know you have
    to develop a site for IE6, you tend to strip away and ignore all the good stuff,
    sticking with the basic core elements of original CSS while trying to find other
    ways around what has been simplified and improved on in newer versions, just so
    your customer who still insists on typing their domain name into google's search
    box instead of the address bar at the top, and who is still convinced that the
    answer to \"what browser do you use\" is either Windows XP, Yahoo or Google, will
    see the site on their ancient system as it appeared on your 3 month old system
    running the latest software and browsers.\r\n\r\nBest one I had, a customer wanted
    a site with all the bells and whistles, heavy flash animation, sounds, the works,
    but it had to work on his computer, it had to load in fast, and he was on, believe
    it or not ... dial up. \r\n\r\nO.o\r\n -"

    care?\r\n\r\nMost certainly will be working more with it. It is a big difference
    from years back, where the mainstream was to use .js to make round cornered divs
    instead of images! We have came a long way."

    when it's a big part of the design.\r\n\r\nWe all know that rounded corners significantly
    improve the \"friendliness\" of a design. This can be crucial to creating the
    right brand and the right feeling. If you only do the rounded corners in CSS3,
    the design will feel completely different in IE.\r\n\r\nI've recently worked on
    two very complex front-end builds that were for rounded-corner heavy PhotoShop
    designs. To save time and complexity, I recommended doing them in CSS3, but the
    clients were insistent on rounded corners. I'd say that added at least a day to
    the front end coding, especially for IE -- and yes, I charged for it. :-)"

    is so simple that I do not find any water in your argument.\r\n\r\nYes I'm a regular
    IE user, because only in using all the browsers, and seeing how browsers behave
    with different designs can I ensure that my users get the best experience from
    my designs.\r\n\r\nYes I would object if I knew that the web page I looked at
    is limited because the designer litteraly could not get himself to spend another
    10 minutes on the design to implement dd roundies. Time that would obviously be
    saved in designing and fitting rounded corners in Photoshop because dd roundies
    does it all.\r\n\r\nRegards"

  content: "I agree with your sentiments but I don't think it's the case that \"IE
    users don't care about rounded corners\". For the majority of users (not concerned
    with cross-browser compatibility), they will use one browser exclusively. If they
    are using IE and see a site that has square corners - they will happily accept
    that the site looks that way. The fact that users of other browsers see rounded
    corners will most likely not cross their minds.\r\n\r\nAs long as the site looks
    good in all browsers, the only people who are likely to notice the differences
    are the designer and the client. As pointed out by others here (and oft-repeated
    by the likes of Andy Clarke and Paul Boag) it doesn't matter that they are different
    and it's a point that clients need to be educated about, preferably before the
    design work begins so as not to look like you're making excuses for bad work.\r\n\r\nMy
    approach (where possible) is that clean markup which looks good and works well
    in all browsers, is far better than over-complicated markup with layers of CSS
    and javascript hacks in an attempt to make the site identical for everyone."

    users aren't going to see the rounded corners why do them at all? Personally I
    have gone down the *make them work on all browsers route* and I wouldn't class
    it as a hack, just an alternative technique which is actually more flexible than
    the CSS technique."

    It's generally worth IE not looking as good and everything else looking awesome.

  content: "@Alwyn\r\n\r\n\"I'm all for limiting functionality for browsers that will
    not support functionality.\"\r\n\r\nWhat does a lack of rounded corners have to
    do with functionality?  The page still functions, it just lacks a minor style
    detail.  That's worth getting upset over?\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, I used to bend
    over backwards for NS 4.7x.  It supported CSS a lot better than people gave it
    credit for.  The difference between NS 4.7x and IE 6 is that minor things can
    cause the page to be unusable, or worse, crash the browser.\r\n\r\nI care enough
    about IE to get it usable and at least come close to honoring the spirit of the
    design.  Some things simply are impossible (such as reformatting tables, which
    I'm a big fan of for certain things).  I'm not going to change my design because
    one archaic browser can't cope.  They'll just have to live with the best their
    browser can do.  And really, they probably don't even know what they're missing."

    I'm just not going to work hard enough to get my site to look just the way I want
    it in a broken web browser because most people are too stupid to download a decent
    one.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying I don't care at ALL how my sites look in IE. I make
    sure they work, and are usable and are half-decent looking, but if they're not

    stupid to upgrade\" irritates me.\r\n\r\nGraceful degradation of a website so
    that it remains functional (if not as pretty) in IE6 is important, particularly
    when working for corporate clients. Many businesses don't upgrade for IE6 because
    they have functionality and developed software that is incompatible with later
    versions. While that may have been a strategic mistake on their part back in the
    day, it means that they and their employees are often stuck using IE6.\r\n\r\nYou
    have to tailor web design to your audience. I can't think of another industry
    where service providers think it's legitimate to say \"sorry, you're too dumb
    to have up to date technology, we won't help you.\"\r\n\r\nI'm lucky in that recent
    projects I've worked on have been for sites that have &lt;5% visitors using IE6,
    so I can safely remove extensive support for that browser. Were I to get a client
    who still received 10% of visitors using IE6 then I'd have to address that though,
    and ensure that lots of their visitors weren't locked out.\r\n\r\nThe arrogance
    that many designers show towards users who either aren't widely knowledgeable
    about upgrade options, or who don't have the option to upgrade because of their
    office policy, often astounds me."

    they will just care that it works. I don't know if that will work for everyone,

    moved since then, and appeared unwilling to help develop CSS3 in the beginning.\r\n\r\nI
    don't really care though for the generel use of rounded corners, they are just
    nice visual effects, and it shouldn't ruin a design if only visible as hard corners
    (fallback). But it gets harder with the more advanced things like transform and
    multiple background-images and border-images. \r\n\r\nThen users of IE&lt;9 will
    miss quite a bit of the nice things, and the web designer has to decide, if this
    is good or bad. I guess this will mean, that the more advanced things will not
    be used for a long time, and that is sad."

  content: "Hi Lee and followers to this post,\r\n\r\nI've started to read your article
    some quite time ago, but per my own immersion into a pile of work that we developers
    normally take on, happily ;) went to bookmark it with this very nice Firefox feature
    that allows me to save group of tags here :D. I'm JP and work as a remote outsourced
    business IT consultant.\r\n\r\n I wanted to share my own thoughts based on my
    UI experiences lately with customers vs the latest cutting edge technologies,
    the reason of not only using CSS3, but as well to migrate to \"code\" in HTML5
    (I'm an advocate of HTML5 on this) + it's research on the web as needed some reference
    about these topics and found myself today reading each of the postings. Is very
    nice to see that we all agree that IE stands for \"I\"mbecile \"E\"ngine.\r\n\r\nHere
    is an interesting image that allows me to think that well is obvious IE is as
    shown on these charts widely used, but there is one thing we are all missing here,
    except for one of your followers who post I working on those using images for
    rounded corners (This is a good approach) \r\n\r\nOh, ok so the thing we are all
    missing is that we should not assume a surfer uses IE only for everything or that
    uses 1 device only. A surfer can be your next shopper so you need to treat your
    visitors (who you might not know in person, but that can get to know you and your
    company through your website) with respect. People visiting your site can be let
    down if someone at his/her workplace can find your website but on his Apple iPhone
    is not rendering properly for example, later on during the day. \r\n\r\nSo here
    is the image from Wikipedia about the market share evaluation and reported by
    Countries\r\n\r\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Countries_by_most_used_web_browser.png\r\n\r\nI
    believe this is quite interesting, several sources have told me that Internet
    Explorer 7 has 4% market share within the Internet Explorer realm of usage worldwide.
    Why is this any interesting? Well, the fact that someone decides not to support
    an specific browser because of compatibility issues is indeed funny because there
    are so many ways to approach these issues on a case by case basis.\r\n\r\n But
    don't be fooled by these images, I might use Internet Explorer for something,
    but I use Google Chrome for my mail and Firefox for development for example, you
    need to think that your code is widely understood by the navigation application
    of the surfer's choice and what is doing at the moment that found your website.
    \r\n\r\nThe truth is to move to code on HTML5 and the supported technologies,
    devices (mobiles) and styling elements such as: CSS3 for not only the browser
    applications but mobile devices as well is actually marking a serious transition
    that we all shall consider to expand.\r\n\r\nIt is well known fact that IE6 (and
    people that were able to code for the Microsoft's unsupported child) is unlikely
    to be seen (except for one computer that I abandoned / refused to use at my home
    town which still uses IE6 because no-one decided to update it :P) nowadays, a
    developer must \"work hard\" to make it possible, but to migrate to use HTML5
    and CSS3 will be the standard for placement of the good source of cash plus the
    fact that you are constantly annoyed already by Microsoft OS telling you to update
    your browser so is unlikely that using IE constantly you aren't going to upgrade
    to the latest version of it which drives me to the point of this article: Internet
    Explorer 9 which seems to support CSS3 with no issues.\r\n\r\nMost problems happen
    not for this reason only, and it's not strange that most of the jobs that are
    recently opening in Fortune 500 and on organizations are either to port a language
    of programming to another to support browser and mobile technologies \"clean user
    experience\" and are willing to invest money there.\r\n\r\nKeeping yourself sharp
    on these matters, can only be beneficial. I've heard that XHTML will be unsupported
    soon while it's going to happen some more time before HTML5 is widely accepted,
    (and potentially supported) as well will mean the defeat (financially) of companies
    that provide CMS that are echoing to the browser code that won't be able to reach
    a top decision maker that is willing to purchase your services on his PALM. \r\n\r\nDon't
    Panic, this only translate for more work! :) Big money spenders on IT are relaxed,
    or young clever people because they invest on the latest cutting  edge technologies,
    and wear \"the gadgets\"\r\n\r\n I think that a developer should do what he think
    is appropriate depending on the project and how it can save him and the client
    lastly lots of time working on it because of the reliability of the solution presented.\r\n\r\n
    Ok, the good stuff :) These two links and to thank Lee for sharing his perspective
    and interesting opinion about this topic.\r\n\r\n-1) jQuery Library Modernizer:\r\nhttp://www.modernizr.com/\r\n(JP:Not
    tested by me, yet but worth the try :P ) It does not do any magic, simply detects
    and attempt to create the CSS base to mimic the behavior, at least is what I understood.
    1) Detects the browser to see if it has Javascript enabled 2) Render classes on
    the document that can be targetted with CSS3 properties like text-shadow, etc.\r\n\r\n-2)
    \r\nie7-js \r\nA JavaScript library to make MSIE behave like a standards-compliant
    browser.\r\n\r\nhttp://code.google.com/p/ie7-js/\r\n(JP: Downloaded it, reviewed
    the js code and related files and looks like a solution that can help addressing
    some of the issues mentioned on this post)\r\n\r\n-3)\r\nDo your homework and
    spice out your content with jQuery and other technologies!\r\n\r\nThe libraries
    at jQueryUI.com (which are very lightweight) are fully customizable with the Theme
    Roller which you can select and download. Most of these use images and sprites
    for rounded corners, so you can add modal and dialog windows, use slider tabs,
    etc using this framework, if you haven't tried... Trust me, it totally worth the
    reading in complement with this article. http://jqueryui.com/demos/\r\n\r\nAnd
    look for jQuery browser function on http://jquery.com which allows you to construct
    a browser navigation detection and trigger events seamlessly. For example you
    can customize a page with basic CSS(1-2) or images for rounded corners and depending
    on the jQuery function detection to apply a class to the file and having it originally
    hidden (display:none or visibility:hidden either) with jQuery you can render it
    smoothly with a time out fading effect... well that was an example but the benefits
    are endless ;)\r\n\r\nAll the best and keep posting good stuff!\r\n\r\nJP-"

<strong>Internet Explorer users don't care about rounded corners.</strong> Bold statement? Perhaps. But recently I've taken this approach to a few designs as I'm tired of having to use some sort of <a href="http://www.cssjuice.com/25-rounded-corners-techniques-with-css/">rounded corner hack</a> to support IE. It's a lot easier to just <strong>use the CSS 3 declaration</strong>.

<!--more-->

If you're up-to-date with your CSS knowledge, you'll know that <strong>CSS 3 has introduced rounded corners</strong>, among other 'goodies'. The problem is though that IE doesn't support CSS 3 yet but Firefox, Safari and Chrome do.

Some CSS 3 techniques I've been using on <a href="http://sharethrough.com">Sharethrough</a> and <a href="http://lookaly.com">Lookaly</a>:
<h4>CSS 3 rounded corners</h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/rounded.jpg" border="0" alt="rounded.jpg" width="540" height="100" /></div>
&nbsp;
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/rounded2.jpg" border="0" alt="rounded2.jpg" width="540" height="100" /></div>
&nbsp;
<pre><code>
div{
-moz-border-radius: 10px;
-webkit-border-radius: 10px;
}
</code></pre>
<h4>CSS 3 text shadow</h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/shadow2.jpg" border="0" alt="shadow2.jpg" width="540" height="100" /></div>
&nbsp;
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/shadow.jpg" border="0" alt="shadow.jpg" width="540" height="100" /></div>
&nbsp;
<pre><code>
div{
text-shadow: -1px -1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.25);
}
</code></pre>
<h4>CSS 3 box shadow</h4>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="http://www.leemunroe.com/wp-content/uploads/shadow3.jpg" border="0" alt="shadow3.jpg" width="540" height="100" /></div>
&nbsp;
<pre><code>
img{
-webkit-box-shadow:0 0 5px 5px rgba(34,34,34,0.3);
-moz-box-shadow:0 0 5px 5px rgba(34,34,34,0.3);
}
</code></pre>
<h4>But how do you deal with clients?</h4>
This is where it gets tricky. If you show a client a mockup with rounded corners and the final solution doesn't have these (because they use IE) they'll probably not be too happy.

If you're working with computer savvy clients, who use Safari or Firefox, they should understand. If you're working on your own personal or side project, happy days. If not, you can try Andy Clarke's approach of <strong>designing in the browser</strong>. <a href="http://stuffandnonsense.co.uk/blog/about/time_to_stop_showing_clients_static_design_visuals/">Time to stop showing clients static design visuals</a> is a very good article about skipping the static mockup stage.
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
The point I'm trying to make here is that <strong>as long as it looks OK in all browsers</strong>, we can afford to take liberties when it comes to making it look nicer for those who use Firefox and Safari. Most designers use Firefox or Safari and they'll appreciate the rounded corners more. IE users <em>*probably*</em> don't care.
