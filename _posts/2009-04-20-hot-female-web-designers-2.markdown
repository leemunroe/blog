    I'd say since you've now compiled 50 hot female designers and the comments mention
    more, maybe we're not \"missing\" as much as we're \"quiet\". ;)\r\n\r\nI'm writing
    a session to give at several web conferences in the next couple months. Can't
    wait to dig through these to find some great examples to use. In fact, maybe my
    whole session should secretly use all female designers which I then reveal at
    the end. Bwahaha  ;)\r\n\r\nThanks again, Lee! See you on twitter..."

    or purple people eaters.

Last year I published '<a href="http://www.leemunroe.com/25-hot-female-web-designers/">25 hot female web designers</a>', showcasing a collection of <strong>female designers who are hot at web design</strong> and had great websites.

With the recent publication of the <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/findingsfromthewebdesignsurvey2008">A List Apart Survey 2008</a>, I thought it was a good opportunity to follow this up with another 25 great designers.

This year's survey found that <strong>16.2% </strong>of those surveyed (29,567 of A List Apart readers) <strong>were female</strong>. That's a <strong>rise of 0.1%</strong>. So there's not much improvement in regards to the amount of females in the industry, but I have came across 25 more great designs.
