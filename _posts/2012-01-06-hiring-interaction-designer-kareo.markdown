Some of the perks of working with Kareo:

<ul>
<li>Get whatever hardware and software you need to produce quality work, whether that's an <strong>Apple MacBook Pro</strong> or an <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=cgcq2tO3Lo4">HP Envy</a></li>
<li>Receive a great salary, with benefits and options in a <strong>company that is growing exponentially</strong></li>
<li>Live and work in <strong>Orange County</strong>, a great location that enables you to surf in the morning and go skiing in the afternoon</li>
<li>Get to do what you love every day - <strong>designing innovative new products</strong></li>
<li>Get to work on <strong>web</strong>, <strong>desktop</strong> and <strong>mobile</strong> products</li>
<li>Drink as much <strong>Coke Zero</strong> as you like from the Kareo fridge</li>
